# ProjectParallel

Parallel Parking a PiCar-S with a Raspberry Pi and an ultrasonic sensor.
Vehicle drives in a straight line until a suitable spot is detected with sufficient space, then it parallel parks itself.
If the vehicle drives by a space that is too small, it will reject the space and continue driving until a suitable space is found.

The progamming was done in Python.
